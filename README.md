## A repo containing projects from online tuition/learning.

This repo contains projects that have been developed as part of the curriculum of mulitple online learning resources.

**DISCLAIMER:** These projects do not contain any confidential information. As such, without specific keys or config files they may not work. This repo is for personal documentation & to demonstrate skill level rather than provide examples of real world projects.

It is also worth noting that some of these projects will have provided suitable 'starter' project code and therefore the exercises you see here may not reflect the approaches or technical solutions I would have chosen.
